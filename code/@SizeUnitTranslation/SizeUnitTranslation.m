% Constructor of the UnitTranslation class with the following properties:
% It is assumed that an array is used to associated this with channels
%    beadtype    % string, right now always RCP-30-5A
%    k_ERF      % ERF = k_ERF*ERF_channel_AU
%    first_peak  % what is the first RCP-30-5A peak visible?
%    fit_error   % residual from the linear fit
%    peak_sets   % all peaks from all channels, for logging and comparison
